# Lemudim-Project-Django
This Project written using Django-python, HTML, CSS, BootStrap.
The idea from this website is to make the remote teaching easily especially in the covid-19 time, so I developed a website that have 3 users (Admin, Teacher, Student).
there are many things that the teacher can do also the Student.
* Uplaod HomeWorks
* Downlaod files
* Send Messages
* Filter subjects
* Choose subject
* Classroom
and a lot..

Enjoy my website ^_^
